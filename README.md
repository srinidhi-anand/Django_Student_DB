# Django_Student_DB


 Code to generate a Semester mark sheet for 3 students with different semesters (2nd, 3rd and 4th). Each semester has 6 courses and each course has 5 tests with varied weightage( 10%, 20%, 30%, %25% and 15% with total of 100%).

The student summary should come in the top,  with name, academic year, roll number, semester, College/University name then the overall marks and % with course wise marks. After that on the details at course and test level details (on expanding) for all the 6 courses the student has enrolled.  5 tests will be conducted for all courses with varying weightages totalling 100% within each course should be designed and shown upon using the expand option/function.
